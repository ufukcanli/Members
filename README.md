#  Members App

This is the take home project that is given by Hipo. This app lists the data that is provided by the company. Users have the ability to sort the data, add a new specific data, see the details and also restore the data. I really enjoyed building this app, it gave me the opportunity to apply the best practices and design patterns that I've been learning for few months while learning iOS development. 

First of all, I really don't like storyboards. They are slow (if you are using a mac that is 5 years old you'll get me) and also they don't give me the full control of my codebase. As a developer who has a little bit experience of web development, I'm pretty used to do the job with code so I always remove the storyboards when I start a new UIKit project.

While doing the job using code, I try to do my best keep my view controllers clean. I always subclass my views to get away from "Massive View Controller" trap. Lately, I've been using a "Boxing" approach to able to use MVVM design pattern. This way I can easily seperate the logic code from view controllers.

Although nobody asked me to the detail screen, I wanted this app to have a simple detail screen. I've been trying SwiftUI for few weeks and I wanted to use it in this project. I believe SwiftUI is so close to be production ready, I can't wait the make apps with it. It does a lot of job under the hood so you can build stuff in a short amount of time. This is awesome especially for indie developers.

And if you keep digging, you can find some extra features too like deleting member, restoring list, empty state message and etc.

I believe I did a great job in few days. I wanted to finish the project as soon as possible because midterms are coming ðŸ˜… Thank you for this opportunity and please feel free to ask me about more specific things. Can't wait the meet you all!
